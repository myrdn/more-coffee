&rarr; I am Myrdin, I work with [Mathilde](https://mental.af) at [clic2000](https://clic2000.fr) in a co-op
([Chrysalide](https://www.cae29.coop/chrysalide.html)).  
<br>
I love coffee and static websites.  
I am learning web development by myself and at my own pace.   
<br>
Here I'll try to share things about my work, what I learn and music; in *not so good* english or french. ðŸ™ƒ
